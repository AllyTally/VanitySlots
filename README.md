# VanitySlots

## What is it?

This mod adds four extra armor slots using the Trinkets mod that lets you display vanity armor instead of your normal armor! If you don't want your armor to show up, you can craft the familiar set of armor by surrounding leather armor with eight glowstone in a crafting table.
